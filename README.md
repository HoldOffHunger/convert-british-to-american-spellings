* Variants for British words.
    * For example, "unrealisable" and "unrealiseable".
* Words are defined with simple associative array, making for a quick transfer to Perl, C++, Java, etc..
    * For example, the syntax of `somekey=>"somevalue"` is widely-used throughout many languages, or easily converted to
      their versions of this syntax.
* Permissively-licensed
    * Do whatever you want with the code!
    * For example, see what others are doing with their personal, commercial, and legal rights as endowed by
      BSD-3-clause-licensed software.

## Functionality

### General Behavior

_How in general does it work?_

* **Exact / Error-Resistant**
    * British/American Spelling Converter uses regular expression checking with `/\b$word\b/`, so this makes it
      impossible to corrupt words.
    * For example, "Ax" becomes "Axe", but "Axiomatic" will remain as "Axiomatic", and cannot become "Axeiomatic", which
      would be incorrect.
* **Fast / Efficient**
    * Every mass-replace is done within a single `preg_replace()` call, using arrays as arguments
    * This means that the script will finish much sooner.
* **Reliable / Atomic / Deterministic**
    * American-ize/British-ify will not corrupt meaning.
    * For example, 'discus' and 'diskus' have reverse meanings in US/UK, swapping them in or out will cause the text to
      change each time you "Americanize" or "Britishify" it. So, we don't do these types of swaps.

### Precise Behavior - Use Cases

_How exactly does it work?_

* Only all lower case, all upper case, or first letter capitalized versions are converted.
    * Example: American=>English, "axe"=>"ax", "AXE" would be converted to "AX" or vice versa, but "AxE would not be
      converted to Ax".
* Apostrophes are treated as word boundaries.
    * Example: American=>English, "axe"=>"ax", "the ax's handle" would be converted to "the axe's handle."
* Only precisely whole, known words are converted.
    * Example: American=>English, "axe"=>"ax", this will not convert "axed" to axd", because the "-d" concluding
      character indicates that it is an entirely different word.
* Dashes are treated as word boundaries only when not preceded and followed by a dash.
    * Example: American=>English, "affecteffect=>affect-effect", this will convert "the affect-effect of it" to "the
      affecteffect of it", but it will not convert "these every-night-affect-effect-happenings are" to "these
      every-every-night-affecteffect-happenings are", as the dash here implies new meaning than when solely alone.
* British alternates are handled.
    * Example: American=>English, "amoebas"=>["amoebae", "amebas", "amebae",], if converting to English, "amoebas" will
      be replaced with "amoebae", the most contemporary term, and if converting to American, "amoebae", "amebas", etc.,
      will all be converted to the single, American equivalent.

_Some test sentences..._

The neighbour walked to the theatre's centre, manoeuvred about the sabre, and proceeded to reconnoitre the sepulchre in
ochre.

The rumour spread that splendour and flavour were affected by our behaviour, so walk a metre in my mitre while carrying
a litre of nitre.

The connexion with industrialisation remains with the municipalisation of the calibre of the fibre of the spectre, not
with the meagre and sombre saltpetre with all its colour and honour.

## Example Usage

_How do I use the British/American Spelling Converter?_

### Americanize Text Example

_How do I convert British-spelling text to American-spelling text?_

```php
require('AmericanBritishSpellings.php');
$american_british_spellings = new AmericanBritishSpellings([]);

$text = "Axiomatically ax that door, would you, my neighbour?";     // British input text source

$americanized = $american_british_spellings->SwapBritishSpellingsForAmericanSpellings(['text'=>$text]);

print($americanized);   // output: Axiomatically axe that door, would you, my neighbor?
```

### Britishize Text Example

_How do I convert American-spelling text to British-spelling text?_

```php
require('AmericanBritishSpellings.php');
$american_british_spellings = new AmericanBritishSpellings();

$text = "Axiomatically axe that door, would you, my neighbor?";     // American input text source

$britishized = $american_british_spellings->SwapAmericanSpellingsForBritishSpellings(['text'=>$text]);

print($britishized);   // output: Axiomatically ax that door, would you, my neighbour?
```

## Code Structure and Design

### Coding Languages

_What coding languages are used in the British/American Spelling Converter?_

The entire project is coded in the following...

* *PHP* - For processing the text and storing the US/UK words.

### Exclude List

_How do you avoiding adding words that would break the deterministic / atomistic model of functionality?_

We do this with an exclude list, which also details the conflict in the words themselves.
